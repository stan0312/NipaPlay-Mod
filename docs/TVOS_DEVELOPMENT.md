# NipaPlay tvOS development

NipaPlay's Apple TV target uses the community
[`fluttertv/flutter-tvos`](https://github.com/fluttertv/flutter-tvos) fork. It
is intentionally versioned independently from the mainline, Linux, and
HarmonyOS Flutter toolchains.

## Pinned toolchain

- flutter-tvos: `v3.44.8-tvos.1.4.3`
- bundled Flutter: `3.44.8`
- deployment target: tvOS 13.0
- application identifier: `com.aimessoft.nipaplay.tvos`

The exact fork tag is stored in `.flutter-version-tvos`. Do not replace the
mainline `.fvmrc` with this version. HarmonyOS keeps its Flutter 3.35-compatible
package interfaces in `pubspec_overrides.ohos.yaml`; adding tvOS does not move
that platform onto the tvOS or mainline toolchain.

## Local setup

Xcode and CocoaPods are required. From the NipaPlay repository root, run:

```bash
./tool/setup_tvos.sh
```

The setup script installs the pinned fork next to the repository by default:

```text
FlutterProject/
  flutter-tvos/
  nipaplay/
```

Set `FLUTTER_TVOS_ROOT` before running the script to use another location.
Use the repository wrapper for subsequent commands so the normal Flutter SDK
is never changed. The wrapper automatically enables
`pubspec_overrides.tvos.yaml`, just as Linux and HarmonyOS select their own
dependency profiles:

```bash
./tool/flutter_tvos.sh doctor -v
./tool/flutter_tvos.sh pub get
./tool/flutter_tvos.sh build tvos --simulator --debug
```

To run the app, install a tvOS Simulator runtime in **Xcode > Settings >
Components**, create an Apple TV simulator, and then use:

```bash
./tool/flutter_tvos.sh devices
./tool/flutter_tvos.sh run -d <apple-tv-device-id>
```

tvOS uses indirect focus navigation rather than touch-style pointer input.
In Simulator, use the arrow keys to move focus, Return to activate, and Escape
to go back; a trackpad or mouse wheel can also move focus. At the root screen,
the Siri Remote MENU button and Simulator Escape key toggle NipaPlay's left
menu instead of leaving the application. In a nested route they retain their
normal back-navigation behavior. NipaPlay always enables its large-screen,
focusable layout on Apple TV.

For a physical Apple TV, select a Development Team for the Runner target in
`tvos/Runner.xcworkspace`, then build or run against the paired device. The
team is deliberately not committed because signing identities are
developer-specific.

## Platform behavior

tvOS is part of the same repository and application source as every other
platform. Shared display-surface and large-screen widgets live under `lib/` and
can also be enabled by desktop, tablet, and television surfaces. Only the
`tvos/` native runner, `.flutter-version-tvos`, the dependency override profile,
and the SDK wrapper are platform-specific. A second Git worktree is optional
for parallel builds; it is not a separate source repository.

The fork reports both `Platform.isIOS == true` and
`Platform.operatingSystem == 'tvos'`. NipaPlay uses the latter to keep Apple TV
out of phone-only code paths and to select the television display surface.

Only Flutter plugins with an explicit `tvos:` implementation are registered.
The target pins the official fluttertv implementations for SharedPreferences,
path provider, package info, SQLite, wakelock, and video playback. Playback is
fixed to the Erika kernel through the tvOS dependency profile; Media Kit, MDK,
file pickers, URL launcher, and camera-based features remain hidden where they
do not have usable tvOS implementations.

Pull-request CI builds an unsigned simulator app. Manual and reusable release
runs build an unsigned arm64 device IPA for sideloading tools to re-sign with
the user's Apple developer identity. This keeps personal teams and provisioning
profiles out of the project while still producing a physical Apple TV package.
App Store or directly installable device-specific artifacts continue to require
Apple signing credentials and a matching tvOS provisioning profile.
